// ng-packagr does not accept an empty entry point, you always need to export something. 
// If no mai entry point needed, as a workaround you can export a dummy variable like a constant with your library name:

export const MY_COMP_UI_SDK = "@mycomp/ui-sdk";

// export * from './src/lib/sdk.service';
// export * from './src/lib/sdk.component';
